# hw2
This is an update to hw1 website incorporating Tailwind to each page to make it more organized and professional looking.
Here is the Netlify link to the main page: https://brave-poitras-fa95d5.netlify.app/index.html
Across the pages, I have tried to incorporate the items listed in the homework including: colours, typography, borders, sizing, box model, flexbox, and responsive design (on each page). 
In addition, there is a form that can be used to submit information on the main page.
The About Us and Benefits pages can be accessed via relative links on the main page and links on these pages can be used to navigate back. 
Please reach out to me at Andrew.Milne@Kellogg.Northwestern.edu if there are any questions or bugs found.
